                Today, the preparation of human sales people is no longer
                sufficient; their motivation fluctuates, and their extremely
                variable efficiency in communication is insufficient in the
                advertisement noise generated by your competitors, which has
                become immense, your potential customers most likely don't even

                Artificial Intelligence performs excellently in many areas, but
                sales is an infinitely complex activity, explicitly requiring
                emotions. People will always buy from companies, during a
                purchase,people give their money for the product or service.
                Right? However, people ALWAYS buy from people!
